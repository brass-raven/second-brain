# Notes

Plugin that automatically creates and opens a [[View/Documentation/Folders Class#DailyNote|DailyNote]] note when you open Obsidian. It also adds a button to go to today's note to the [[View/Documentation/Layout#Ribbon|ribbon]] and the experience is greatly enhanced by the [[View/Documentation/Plugins Calendar|Calendar Plugin]].
