# Second Brain

Second Brain is a vault set up to work in the incredible note taking application [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md).

It comes with scripts that allow you to quickly and easliy add notes for many types of media such as Books, Movies, & YouTube videos that will automatically populate the note with data using APIs.

## Setup

1. Install [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md).
  - Note: I use [brew to install Obsidian](https://formulae.brew.sh/cask/obsidian#default).
2. Clone the repository to where you want your notes kept.
