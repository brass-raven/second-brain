# Notes

Added in [[View/Documentation/Release Notes 1.2.0|Second Brain 1.2.0]].

This plugin makes line numbers display how far away they are from the user's cursor instead of the line number from the top of the file.

This is convenient when [[View/Documentation/Tips and Tricks#^enableVim|enabling Vim mode]] and using its commands, but both Vim mode & this plugin are off by default (as of [[View/Documentation/Release Notes 1.2.0|Second Brain 1.2.0]]) as they take some time to master.
