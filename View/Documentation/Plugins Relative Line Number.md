# Notes

This plugin makes line numbers display how far away they are from the user's cursor instead of the line number from the top of the file.

This is convenient when [[View/Documentation/Tips and Tricks#^enableVim|enabling Vim mode]] and using its commands, but both Vim mode & this plugin are off by default (as of [[View/Documentation/Release Notes Upcoming|Upcoming Release]]) as they take some time to master.
