# Notes

This document will walk you through the main areas of Obsidian and explain the content in each area. The [[#Ribbon]], [[#Left Panel]], & [[#Right Panel]] contain most of the important information.

It is worth noting that you can move, remove, and add items to various areas if you are unhappy with the layout I use. The [[View/Documentation/Plugins Commander|Commander Plugin]] can be a useful tool when adding buttons to different areas of the layout.

If you are on the mobile app, then there is also a button to trigger the [[View/Documentation/Hotkeys#^addNew|add new functionality]] and a button to edit the currently open note's properties using [[View/Documentation/Plugins Metadata Menu|Metadata Menu Plugin]] that were added using [[View/Documentation/Plugins Commander|Commander Plugin]].

## Tabs

You can click the `X` to close them (or use the [[View/Documentation/Hotkeys#^closeTab|close tab hotkey]] like a professional) and for files with a [[View/Documentation/Metadata#Class Property|class property]] you will see an icon next to the close button that will let you open the [[View/Documentation/Plugins Metadata Menu|property modal]].
