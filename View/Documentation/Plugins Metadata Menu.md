# Notes

This plugin allows you to create [[View/Documentation/Folders Class|classes/types of notes]] that let you specify which properties the [[View/Documentation/Metadata|metadata]] of each note should have and what type each property should be. It basically turns your notes into a [[View/Documentation/Folders Database|database]] where each [[View/Documentation/Folders Class|class]] is a table, their properties are columns, and notes with their `class` property set to them are records in their table.
