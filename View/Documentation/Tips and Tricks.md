# Notes

This documentation is focused on minor improvements to my workflow that I decided would be nice for people to not have to discover on their own.

# Essential Tips

* Hold command when hovering over [[View/Documentation/Obsidian Syntax#Internal Link|internal links]] to see a preview.
* Hold command when opening notes to open them in a new tab.
* When creating [[View/Documentation/Obsidian Syntax#Internal Link|internal links]] you can type `[[`, start typing the name of the note, then link directly to a [[View/Documentation/Obsidian Syntax#Link To A Header|header]] or [[View/Documentation/Obsidian Syntax#Link To A Block|block]] by typing `#` or `^` respectively.
* When creating [[View/Documentation/Obsidian Syntax#Internal Link|internal links]] you can hit `Tab` to start typing a link alias or `Enter` to finish the link quickly once the correct note/header/block is displaying in the autocomplete.
* You can right click on an open tab and pin it to keep it open when you click on its links.
* If you want to delete a file, but you are not sure if anything links to it, then check its [[View/Documentation/Layout#Backlinks|backlinks]].
