# Notes

Workspaces are used to save your current Obsidian UI state. This includes the notes you have open, the panels you have collapsed/expanded, and where you have all of the [[View/Documentation/Layout|Layout]].

The vault currently has one workspace called "Edit" that you can enable (warning, this will take you to a different note) by clicking the pencil icon in the [[View/Documentation/Layout#Ribbon|ribbon]]. You can change the state that is saved for the workspace by using the [[View/Documentation/Hotkeys#^saveWorkspace|save workspace hotkey]].

You can add new workspaces using the [[View/Documentation/Hotkeys#^openCommandPalette|command palette]] and add buttons to access them using the [[View/Documentation/Plugins Commander|Commander Plugin]].
