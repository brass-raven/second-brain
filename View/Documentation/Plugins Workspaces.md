# Notes

Workspaces are used to save your current Obsidian UI state. This includes the notes you have open, the panels you have collapsed/expanded, and where you have all of the [[View/Documentation/Layout|Layout]].

The vault currently has one workspace called "Edit" that you can enable (warning, this will take you to a different note) by clicking the pencil icon in the [[View/Documentation/Layout#Ribbon|ribbon]]. You can change the state that is saved for the workspace by using the [[View/Documentation/Hotkeys#^saveWorkspace|save workspace hotkey]].

You can add new workspaces using the [[View/Documentation/Hotkeys#^openCommandPalette|command palette]] and add buttons to access them using the [[View/Documentation/Plugins Commander|Commander Plugin]].

## Workspaces

### Edit

The edit workspace ([[View/Documentation/Layout#Ribbon|activated from the ribbon]]) is used to track what you are currently working on so you can quickly come back to it if you go down a rabbit hole for a bit. It defaults to opening the [[View/Documentation/Quickstart|Quickstart]] note, but once you feel comfortable with that feel free to save over this view all the time while you work.

### Home

The home workspace ([[View/Documentation/Layout#Ribbon|activated from the ribbon]]) is the main view where you can navigate out from to find the rest of the notes (or use [[View/Documentation/Hotkeys#^openQuickSwitcher|the quick switcher]]).
