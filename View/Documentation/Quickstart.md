# Notes

If you want to learn by doing, then read through the following minimal documentation (I know it is still a lot, but you will be better for it), then send it. You can always come back and read about specific sections later.

If you prefer to read everything, then the [[View/Documentation/README|README document]] might be a better starting point.

> [!note] If you get lost, you can click the pencil icon below the home icon on the far left of Obsidian to get back to Quickstart.
