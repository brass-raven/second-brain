# Notes

This plugin allows you to create drawings that can even link/embed your other notes into them and then you can embed them into your other notes similar to what I did with the [[View/Documentation/Layout#^layoutDrawing|Layout]].

Its notes will default to being created in the [[View/Documentation/Folders Excalidraw|Excalidraw Folder]], but I might move them into the [[View/Documentation/Folders Asset|Asset Folder]] later.
